#
# types of groups: users' private groups, resource access groups, special groups.
# - types of users' private groups: root's, daemons', humans'. the idea is not to share them with anyone.
# - types of resource access groups: file, device, service. the idea is to partition and share the access to resources.
# - special groups: anybody = contains anyone; nobody = contains no one.
#
# with sharing between deamons and users, there are two configurations:
#	1) the daemon sees nothing but its private files with <daemon>:<daemon> ownership, but some power users
#	have access to the daemon's private group and thus they are the masters of the daemons.
#	2) the daemon is part of some file access group, thus it can opt to have really private files.
