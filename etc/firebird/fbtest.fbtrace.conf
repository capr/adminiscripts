# Trace configuration. Following rules are used :
# - configuration is processed from top to bottom
# - there is two kind of sections allowed : "database" and "services"
# - parameters at default section are used for all databases or services
# - only one default section for each kind is allowed
# - after processing of default database section, search is continued
# - if database name matches pattern, options are immediately applied and
#   search does not continue
#
# Pattern is either database name without path or "SIMILAR TO"-based regular
# expression which is matched against fully qualified database path name.
#
# For log file name Sed syntax for substitutions is supported.
# I.e. \0 - whole matched string, \1 ... \9 - parenthesis subexpressions. 
# \\ is backslash.
